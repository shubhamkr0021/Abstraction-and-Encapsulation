    "Abstraction in object-oriented programming is a fundamental concept that involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on real-world objects and their essential characteristics and behaviors. It allows you to focus on the relevant details of an object while hiding unnecessary complexity. Abstraction provides a way to create a blueprint or template for objects, defining their properties and behaviors (methods) without specifying all the implementation details."

In Python, you can use a single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute) to indicate that an attribute is intended to be private, but it's more of a convention, as Python doesn't enforce strict access control.\n",
